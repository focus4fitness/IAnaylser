# Instagram Analyzer
The Instagram Analyzer is a project that allows the user to enter the username of an Instagram account and obtain a complete dashboard with an analysis of the interactions of the latest publications, as well as a summary of the requested profile. The analysis is performed using dynamic tables, interactive graphs and widgets, with filters and manipulation of graphs and variables to facilitate hypothesis validation and insights. The project uses the main data analysis tools in Python, such as Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas, to create an interactive user interface and provide dynamic visualizations of Instagram data.
